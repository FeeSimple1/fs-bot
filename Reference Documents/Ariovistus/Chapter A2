A2.0 SEQUENCE OF PLAY
A2.1 Set Up
Follow the instructions on the pages 13-17 of this expansion booklet
to choose either Ariovistus or The Gallic War scenario, assign Fac-
tions to players, prepare the deck, and set up markers and Forces.
A2.2 Start
RECORD STEPS: Use a black Eligibility cylinder for
the Germanic Faction, replacing the green cylinder.
A2.3 Event Card
=
A2.3.2 Faction Order. In Ariovistus, the Germans use the round
green Arverni symbol when checking cards from Falling Sky for
Faction order. They use the black Germanic Tribes symbol on new
cards exclusive to Ariovistus.
A2.3.3 Passing. When the Germanic Tribes Faction Passes, it re-
ceives plus 1 Resource (as highlighted in light gray on the Ariovistus
Sequence of Play sheet).
Arverni Phase
if Arverni At War
A2.3.9 Arverni Activation. Many new cards in Ariovistus bear an
additional initiative symbol at top right—a greenish carnyx (Celtic
trumpet). This symbol cues a check regarding whether the Arverni
are currently “At War” or not and, if At War, Triggers an immediate
Arverni activation (“Arverni Phase”) after the regular Sequence of
Play proceeds. The Arverni Phase rules section A6.2 details these
procedures.
PLAY NOTE: The Arverni Trigger symbol appears on 24 (one third)
of 72 Event cards from which the Ariovistus deck is drawn.
AT WAR MARKERS: During play of Ario-
vistus, keep one At War marker near the deck,
with the appropriate side up showing whether
the Arverni are At War or At Peace. When the
next card showing bears the Arverni At War? Carnyx symbol and
the Arverni are At War, place that At War marker on that card as a
reminder to conduct an Arverni Phase before the normal Sequence
of Faction Play on that card. Use remaining At War markers to
denote Regions Triggering Arverni At War, as described in A6.2.
