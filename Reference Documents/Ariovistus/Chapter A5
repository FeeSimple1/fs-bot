A4.6.2 Intimidate. Intimidation cows enemies into submission. It
may accompany March, Raid, or Battle Commands (A3.4.2 .4), not
Rally. Select Regions as desired that either:
• Have Ariovistus (A1.4), OR
• Are under Germanic Control (1.6) and either lie within a distance
of one Region from Ariovistus or have his Successor in them
(A4.1.2).
PROCEDURE: Each selected Region, flip one or two Hidden Ger-
manic Warbands to Revealed in order to place an Intimidated marker
there (if none is there already) and to remove that many Warbands,
Auxilia, and/or Allies there of one Faction that has no Leader there.
INTIMIDATED: Intimidated markers block Recruit and
Rally in their Region by non-Germanic Factions that have
no Leader there (A3.2.1, A3.3.1). Only one Intimidated
marker may occupy each Region. They are removed in Spring
(A6.6).
NOTE: Germanic Warbands Raiding in Ariovistus’s Region may
Intimidate for free, without it counting as a Special Ability (A3.4.3);
they could Intimidate there again with additional hidden Warbands
if the Germans then added Intimidate as a normal Special Ability.
A4.6.3 Ambush. Germanic Ambush in Ariovistus selects Regions
and modifies Battle like Arverni Ambush in Falling Sky (4.3.3)
but uses Germanic instead of Arverni pieces (including Ariovistus
instead of Vercingetorix).
