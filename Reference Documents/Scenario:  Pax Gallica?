Pax Gallica?
54 BC, late Summer: For two years, the
Gauls have remained pacified, allowing Cae-
sar to probe first Germania, then Britannia.
Three of his legions back on the mainland
are busy building replacement ships and
guarding harbors and provisions; they soon
will need quarters among friendly Belgae
to cope with a bad harvest. Drought and
political calm mean little corn is stocked
for war. While constant intrigues simmer in
Rome, pre-Civil War machinations against
Caesar are yet to boil. But chieftains of the
Eburones, Treveri, Senones, and others are
plotting—how long can peace in Gaul last?
This long scenario offers an extended buildup
and a wider range of diversion from the story
as it happened to play out historically.
Deck
Deal 70 Events into 14 piles of five Events
each. Shuffle one Winter card each into the
2nd, 5th, 8th, 11th, and 14th piles. Stack the
piles, 1st pile on top, 14th at bottom.
1st Winter Special Rules
Winter Track Setup:
• Winter marker in Quarters box
• 3x Legions in Harvest Phase box
• Senate marker in Senate box
• Vercingetorix in Spring box
During the 1st Winter Round:
Skip that Victory Phase (the game continues)
and that Germans Phase. NOTE: The pre-
position of the Winter marker in the Quarters
box is a reminder.
At the start of that Harvest Phase, the Romans
place the three Legions from the Winter
Track into any Belgica Region(s).
At the start of that Senate Phase, instead of
shifting the Senate, put its marker at Intrigue
(not Firm).
Beginning that Spring Phase, the Arverni
may at any time place Vercingetorix from
the Spring box into any Region (symbol up).
