Ariovistus
58 BC: Competing Celts have invited merce-
nary Germans and then a covetous Rome into
their divided Gaul as protectors. Before Cae-
sar’s audacious claim to the whole of Gaul
leads his legions even farther north to war
with the Belgae, an ambitious Sueban will
call ever more warbands out of Germania’s
forests to launch his own bid for dominion…
This expansion scenario takes us back to
Caesar’s first entry into Gaul, with Helve-
tian migration challenging the Aedui and
Germanic Tribes pressing close behind. The
scenario should play in about the same time
as Falling Sky’s main scenario.
Deck
Replace Falling Sky Event cards with
Ariovistus cards as specified under Deck
Preparation above. Shuffle the 72 Events.
Deal 45 into nine piles of five Events each.
Shuffle one Winter card each into the 3rd,
6th
, and 9 th piles. Stack the piles, 1 st pile on
top, 9th at the bottom. (Or, if preferred for a
shorter game, deal 30 Events into six piles
with two Winter cards, one each in the 3rd
and 6 th piles.)
Near the deck, mark the Arverni as “At War”.
Available Forces
Add 6 Germanic Settlements and 15 Ger-
manic Warbands (to a total of 30). Add
Diviciacus. Remove Vercingetorix from play.
DESIGN NOTE: “Ambiorix” in this scenario
represents Boduognatus, commander of the
Nervii (A1.4), who seems to have had a simi-
lar fighting style focused on surprise Attack.
