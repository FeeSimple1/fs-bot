# Non-Player Guidelines Summary (8.1 - 8.4)
# Base game (2nd Edition)
# This is a summary card. All content here is found in Chapter 8 sections
# 8.1 through 8.4. Transcribed for coding reference.

Limited Commands (8.1.2, 2.3.5):
  Non-player Factions entitled to a Limited Command by the Sequence of
  Play (not by Event) instead execute a full Command and Special Ability.

Frost (8.4.4, 2.3.8, 7.2):
  While Winter is showing, Non-players take no action that directly could
  advance a player Faction above or any further beyond its victory threshold.

Dual Use Events (8.2.2, 5.2):
  Non-players executing Dual Use Events choose the following text, unless
  their Event Instructions (8.1.2) say otherwise:
  - Aedui and Romans: unshaded.
  - Belgae and Arverni: shaded.

Random Selection (8.3.4):
  For any candidates of equal priority, choose by equal-chance die rolls.

Retreat (8.4.3, 3.2.4, 3.3.4, 8.4.2):
  - Non-players Retreat to save their last piece, or — if Romans — to
    reduce Losses on Legions, or if:
    (1) They have no Citadel or Fort, and
    (2) They would inflict <1/2 the Losses as they would suffer, and
    (3) Retreat itself removes no pieces.
  - Warbands stay in place when able; Leaders join most friendly pieces.
  - Most Non-players do not allow other Factions to Retreat into their
    Control; Aedui and Romans might for the other (8.6.6, 8.8.6).

Event Actions (8.2.3, 5.1):
  Non-players when executing Events:
  - For free Commands and Special Abilities, follow their flowcharts.
  - For actions by Germans, follow the Germans Phase rules (6.2).
  - When a choice who gets benefits, select themselves only.

Event Locations (8.3.1):
  Within above and any Instructions (8.2.1), select Regions to place or
  remove the most Legions, then Citadels, Allies, other pieces (then
  within 8.4.1).
  - Use Capabilities wherever first applicable (8.3.3).

Resources & Supply Lines (8.4.2, 1.5.2, 3.2.1):
  Most Non-players do not give away Resources or agree to Supply Lines;
  Aedui-Romans might (8.6.6, 8.8.6).

Place and Remove (8.4.1, 1.4.1):
  - Once Regions picked, target enemy Leaders; then Legions;
    Citadels/Forts; Allies (Cities first); Warbands/Auxilia (Hidden,
    Revealed, Scouted).
  - Place own pieces in above order; remove own in the reverse order.
  - Belgae/Arverni target Romans, then Aedui, each other, Germans.
  - Romans/Aedui target Arverni, then Belgae, Germans, each other.

Harassment (8.4.2, 3.2.2, 3.2.3, 3.3.2):
  Belgae and Arverni Harass only Roman March and Seize; Aedui and Romans
  Harass only Vercingetorix March.
