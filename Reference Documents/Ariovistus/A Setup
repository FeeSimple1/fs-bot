Setup & Scenarios (A2.1)
General
Regardless of scenario, replace the five original Falling Sky
Available Forces displays with their upgraded versions from this
expansion (A1.4.1).
For Ariovistus, assign players their Factions as follows (A1.5) or
use Non-players per A8.0:
2-player—Romans and Aedui versus Germans and Belgae.
3-player—Romans versus Aedui versus Germans and Belgae, or
Romans and Aedui versus Germans versus Belgae.
4-player—A Faction each player, Romans, Germans, Aedui, and
Belgae.
Give the Germanic player the Ariovistus Germanic Tribes sheet.
Give the Roman, Aedui, and Belgic players each the reference
playing card for that Faction. If using any non-German Non-
players, place those Non-player Factions’ reference cards near the
Non-player aid foldouts. NOTE: These cards list key Ariovistus
changes to that Faction’s Commands, Special Abilities (A4.0), and
victory (A7.0), or to its Non-player rules (A8.0).
Deck Preparation
Regardless of scenario, we recommend replacing the following
five original Falling Sky cards with their 2nd Edition versions
bearing the same title:
11. Numidians 2nd Ed
30. Vercingetorix’s Elite 2 nd Ed (Replaced In Ariovistus)
39. River Commerce 2nd Ed
44. Dumnorix Loyalists 2 nd Ed
54. Joined Ranks 2nd Ed
NOTE: See the Card List and Event Text and Notes in the Ario-
vistus Playbook for more information on the expansion cards.
Diviciacus Leader Option: Original Falling Sky can use the
expansion version of card 38, Diviciacus 2 nd Ed, with the
Diviciacus Leader piece and rules in A1.4. If using the Roman
Non-player, Romans Battle Diviciacus only when Aedui at 0+
victory (A8.8.1).
For Ariovistus, remove the 39 Falling Sky Event cards listed below
and replace them one for one with the 39 expansion cards marked
with A. The expansion cards for Ariovistus bear the same number
as the original that they replace, but preceded by an “A”. NOTE:
Some of the new cards bear the same Event title and modify the
original for the new scenario; most are entirely new.
• Remove cards 19-36—all 18 cards with Arverni as the first
symbol—and replace them with cards A19-A36 (all Germanic
Tribes first).
• Replace the following three Roman first cards with A5,
A17, and A18:
5. Gallia Togata
17. Germanic Chieftains
18. Rhenus Bridge
• Replace these seven Aedui first cards with A37, A38, A40,
A43, A45, A51, and A53:
37. Boii
38. Diviciacus
40. Alpine Tribes
43. Convictolitavis
45. Litaviccus
51. Surus
53. Consuetudine
• Finally, replace these eleven Belgae first cards with A56,
A57, A58, A60, A63, A64, A65, A66, A67, A69, and A70:
56. Flight Of Ambiorix
57. Land Of Mist And Mystery
58. Aduatuca
60. Indutiomarus
63. Winter Campaign
64. Correus
65. German Allegiances
66. Migration
67. Arduenna
69. Segni & Condrusi
70. Camulogenus
Even Initiative Option: For an arranged distribution of Fac-
tion initiative in any scenario except Pax Gallica?, before deck
preparation, sort Event cards in 4 piles by the Faction symbol
that is 1 st on each card. Shuffle each pile and deal evenly from
each into a new pile until the new pile just reaches or exceeds
the needed number of cards for that scenario (30, 45, or 60).
Then shuffle the new pile and deal into final piles from that.
NOTE: Pax Gallica? already provides an even distribution of
initiative across the full length of the scenario, because nearly
all cards are used.
