Reconquest of Gaul
53 BC, mid-Winter: Belgic warbands
have suddenly massed around the legions’
dispersed winter garrisons, while defection
from Roman rule stirs in Celtica. Can Caesar
and the Aedui get north to beat back Ambi-
orix, before Vercingetorix unifies the Celts
in resistance?
This main scenario begins with the Belgae
having sprung a trap and close to victory. To
the south, Vercingetorix is on the scene but
has yet to rally the tribes he needs to chal-
lenge Caesar. While Rome’s position appears
strong in subdued tribes, the Arverni are
about to undo that. The Romans must bal-
ance the Belgic emergency with pruning the
budding Arverni rebellion, while their Aedui
friends weigh how much and how long to
help them do so.
Deck
Deal 60 Events into 12 piles of five Events
each. Shuffle one Winter card each into
the 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th piles. Stack the
piles, 1st pile on top, 12th at bottom. (Or, if
preferred for a shorter game, deal 45 Events
into nine piles with three Winter cards, one
each in the 3rd, 6th, and 9th piles.)
See setup illustration on back cover.
