A7.0 VICTORY
NOTE: The Arverni Faction does not track or achieve victory in
Ariovistus.
A7.1 Ranking Wins and Breaking Ties
Ties go to any Non-players (8.0), then the Romans, then the Ger-
mans, then the Aedui.
A7.2 Exceeding Victory Threshold
Ariovistus adds Germanic victory and effects of Germanic Settle-
ments on Roman and Aedui victory. The conditions are—
• Romans: Subdued plus Dispersed plus Roman Allied Tribes less
Germanic Settlements on the map exceeds 15.
• Germans: Germania Regions under Germanic Control
plus German Settlements under Germanic Control
exceeds 6.
• Aedui: Aedui Allied Tribes plus Citadels exceeds those of each
other Faction, counting Germanic Settlements as Germanic Allies.
• Belgae: Total Belgic Control Value plus Belgic Allies and Citadels
exceeds 15.
PLAY NOTE: To check the Roman score, add up the numbers of
non-Roman Allies, Citadels, and Settlements on the map—as shown
on the Forces displays—and subtract from 30 (31 with Colony
Event in play).
A7.3 During the Final Winter
Ariovistus victory margins are—
• Romans: Subdued + Dispersed + Roman Allied Tribes –
Settlements – 15.
• Germans: Germania Regions + Settlements under Germanic
Control – 6.
• Aedui: Aedui-Allied Tribes + Citadels – those of the other Faction
with the most, counting Settlements as Germanic Allies.
• Belgae: Belgic Control Value + plus Belgic Allied Tribes and
Citadels – 15.
