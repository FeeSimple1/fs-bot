SETUP (2.1)
General
Choose a scenario and any Sudden Frost (2.3.8) and Non-player
(if fewer than four players, 1.5, 8.0, 8.9) options desired. Prepare
the deck per the instructions below and per the scenario. Give
each player a Faction foldout, and assign players their Factions
(1.5, or see 8.0 Non-player option):
2-player—Romans and Aedui versus Arverni and Belgae.
3-player—Romans versus Aedui versus Arverni and Belgae, or
Romans and Aedui versus Arverni versus Belgae.
4-player—A Faction each player, Romans, Arverni, Aedui, and
Belgae.
Place each player’s Available Forces display(s) near them and
in view of all players (1.4.1). Place the Germanic Forces display
near the east edge of the map. Put the wooden Forces pieces on
their displays and all markers in a pile or receptacle within easy
reach. Keep remaining aid sheets at hand. Set up the game board
per the scenario, placing Forces and markers onto the board as
listed. NOTE: Colors in the scenario setups highlight the setup
of Forces for each Faction.
Deck Preparation
Separate out the five Winter cards. Shuffle the Event cards and
randomly deal them into a number of facedown piles of five cards
each as specified in the scenario. Shuffle one Winter card into
certain five-card piles, as the scenario specifies. Stack the first
pile onto the second onto the third, and so on, to form a single
facedown draw deck in easy view of all players. Set aside any
remaining Event and Winter cards—they will not be used and
may not be inspected
