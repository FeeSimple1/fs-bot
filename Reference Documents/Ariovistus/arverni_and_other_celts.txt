# Arverni and Other Celts — Arverni Phase (A2.3.9, A6.2)
# Ariovistus expansion aid sheet
# Transcribed from physical component image.
#
# This sheet summarizes the Arverni Phase, the game-run activation
# system for Arverni in Ariovistus (they are neither a player nor a
# standard Non-player bot). Full rules in Chapter A6.
#
# KEY NEW CONTENT: The "Roll to Select Targets" die table (A6.2) is
# referenced but not printed in Chapter A6. This sheet is its only source.


# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# SELECT TARGETS (A6.2)
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# Entry condition (diamond):
# If At War — any non-Arverni Forces in Arverni Home Regions or
# with Arverni Allies or Citadels:

SELECT_TARGETS:
  1. Roll to select target Region from those above.
  2. Then roll again to select target Faction there.
  - Each roll, track down column and back to top until suitable
    candidate is selected.
  3. Mark Target Faction in Target Region.
  If At Peace, no Arverni Phase.


# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# ARVERNI HOME REGIONS (A1.3.1, A6.2)
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# - Veneti Region
# - Carnutes Region
# - Pictones Region
# - Arverni Region
# [Sheet includes a map image highlighting these four regions]

# ROLL TO SELECT TARGETS (A6.2)
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# This table is THE AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE for the die-to-target
# mapping. Chapter A6 describes the procedure but does not list
# which die face maps to which Region or Faction.
#
# Die Roll  | Target Region        | Target Faction
# ----------|----------------------|-------------------
# 1-2       | Most Enemy Pieces    | Enemy With Most
# 3         | Arverni              | Aedui
# 4         | Carnutes             | Germans
# 5         | Pictones             | Romans
# 6         | Veneti               | Belgae
#
# PROCEDURE (from A6.2):
# - Roll a die. Check if that result yields a valid candidate:
#   Region column: must be an "At War" Region (has non-Arverni
#   Forces in an Arverni Home Region, or has Arverni Allies/Citadels
#   with non-Arverni Forces). For roll 1-2, select the triggering
#   Region with the most enemy pieces total.
#   Faction column: must have Forces in the Target Region. For
#   roll 1-2, select the enemy Faction with the most pieces there.
# - If the roll does not yield a valid candidate, track down the
#   column (3→4→5→6→1→2→3→...) until a valid one is found.
# - Choose among equal candidates randomly.
#
# NOTE: The two columns are rolled INDEPENDENTLY — first a roll
# for Region, then a separate roll for Faction. The Region and
# Faction rolls need not match.


# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# RALLY (A6.2.1)
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# Header: Per Arverni Rally rules (3.3.1), in Regions that are
# neither Intimidated nor Devastated (A6.2.1):

RALLY:
  1. Only in "At War" Regions, only once per Region.
  2. Replace City Allies with Citadels in Regions able.
  3. Then elsewhere, place Arverni Allies as able, first at Cities,
     then in Arverni Region, then elsewhere.
  4. Then elsewhere, place Arverni Warbands as able (Allies and
     Citadels +1, or 1 in Home).
  - Choose among candidates randomly. Adjust Control.

# CROSS-REFERENCE vs A6.2.1:
# The sheet condenses "starting at Cities, then in Arverni Home
# Regions, then elsewhere" (A6.2.1) to "first at Cities, then in
# Arverni Region, then elsewhere." The sheet says "Arverni Region"
# (singular) where A6.2.1 says "Arverni Home Regions" (plural).
# This is a meaningful difference: the sheet implies the Arverni
# Region specifically gets Ally placement priority, while the rules
# text says all four Home Regions do. DEFER TO CHAPTER A6.2.1
# (the full rules text) as authoritative.


# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# MARCH (A6.2.2)
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# Header: To adjacent (A6.2.2, 3.3.2); not if Frost:

MARCH:
  1. All Arverni Warbands Hidden (or remove Scouted).
  2. From Regions with 1+ more Arverni than Control — but never
     from target Region.
  3. With as many Warbands as possible without losing Arverni
     Control, largest moving groups first.
  4. Into target Region, then 1 other Region where able to remove
     Aedui Control then Roman Control.

# CROSS-REFERENCE vs A6.2.2:
# Step 2: Sheet says "1+ more Arverni than Control." A6.2.2 says
# "at least 1 Arverni Warband beyond the pieces needed for Arverni
# Control." Consistent — same meaning.
# Step 4: Sheet says "remove Aedui Control then Roman Control."
# A6.2.2 says "either Aedui or Roman Control in it — Aedui first."
# Consistent.


# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# RAID (A6.2.3)
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# Header: Where Hidden Arverni and another Faction has pieces but
# neither Fort nor Citadel (A6.2.3, 3.3.3):

RAID:
  1. Only with Warbands not needed to enable Ambush.
  2. Only against Factions with Resources.
  3. Against target Faction first, then other players, then other
     Non-players, then at random.
  4. With as many Arverni Warbands as possible.

# CROSS-REFERENCE vs A6.2.3:
# Step 2: Sheet says "Only against Factions with Resources." A6.2.3
# adds "and no Fort or Citadel" and "only until that Faction reaches
# 0 Resources." The Fort/Citadel restriction is in the header, not
# repeated in the bullets. The "until 0" detail is omitted from the
# sheet — it's implicit in the Raid rules (3.3.3) but worth noting.
# Step 3: Sheet says "then at random." A6.2.3 says "Otherwise,
# choose randomly among Target Factions within a Region." Same
# meaning.


# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# BATTLE + AMBUSH (A6.2.4)
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# Header: With Arverni where another Faction that has fewer Hidden
# pieces (A6.2.4, 3.3.4):

BATTLE_AMBUSH:
  1. Only where Arverni can Ambush (no Leader needed) to cause
     enemy Loss.
  2. First in selected target Region, then in others.
  3. Within each Region, against selected target Faction first, then
     other players, then other Non-players.

# CROSS-REFERENCE vs A6.2.4:
# "(no Leader needed)": Correct — Vercingetorix is not in play in
# Ariovistus, and the Arverni have no Leader piece. Ambush
# eligibility (4.3.3) normally requires a Leader or Hidden Warbands,
# but the sheet clarifies that for Arverni the Leader requirement is
# waived (since they have none). This is implicit in the rules but
# the sheet makes it explicit.
# Actually, re-reading 4.3.3: Ambush requires Hidden Warbands
# with fewer Hidden enemy pieces — the Leader enables Ambush
# WITHOUT Hidden Warbands. Since Arverni have no Leader, they
# must rely on Hidden Warbands, which is the normal Ambush path.
# The "(no Leader needed)" on the sheet means "Arverni Ambush
# works even without a Leader" — i.e., don't skip Ambush just
# because Arverni have no Leader on the map.


# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# AGREE, HARASS, LOSS (A1.5.2, A3.2.4)
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

AGREE_HARASS_LOSS:
  1. Arverni never agree, never Retreat, and always opt to Harass
     (A3.2.1, A3.2.4, A3.2.2).
  2. Arverni suffering Losses in Battle remove Scouted, then other
     Revealed, then Hidden Warbands; then Allies, from Cities last;
     finally Citadels (A3.2.4).

# CROSS-REFERENCE vs A1.5.2 and A3.2.4:
# Bullet 1: A1.5.2 says "The Arverni never agree, Harass at every
# opportunity, and may not receive Resources." The sheet's
# "(A3.2.1, A3.2.4, A3.2.2)" maps to: Supply Lines (A3.2.1),
# Retreat (A3.2.4), and March Harassment (A3.2.2).
#
# Bullet 2 — ARVERNI LOSS ORDER: This is a critical rule for
# coding. The Arverni have a UNIQUE loss absorption order that
# differs from both standard Gallic and Roman loss orders:
#   Standard Gallic: Hidden Warbands stay, Revealed removed first
#   Arverni in Ariovistus: Scouted first, then Revealed, then Hidden,
#     then Allies (Cities last), then Citadels.
# This is the REVERSE of normal Gallic practice (where Hidden
# Warbands are protected). The Arverni sacrifice concealment to
# preserve their alliance network. Confirmed in A3.2.4.

# SUMMARY OF NEW INFORMATION (not in Chapter A6 text)
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# 1. DIE ROLL TABLE: The specific die-face-to-target mapping for
#    Select Targets. This is the only source for which numbers map
#    to which Regions and Factions. ESSENTIAL for implementation.
#
# 2. Everything else on the sheet is a condensed summary of rules
#    already in Chapter A6, A1.5.2, and A3.2.4. One minor wording
#    discrepancy noted in Rally (see cross-reference note above).
